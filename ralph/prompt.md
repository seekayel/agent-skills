research additional information on the project in the docs directory.

For the feature that is requested, pick the next most important issue in `prd.json` and implement it. Or if there are are more important work items that are necessary for the requeseted feature, based on your research in the docs directory that have not been added to `prd.json` add them and then pick one to workon.

Update `prd.json` when the issue is done. After completing an issue is it ok to add necessary additional work as issues to `prd.json`

If `prd.json` doesn't exist or everything is marked as done research and find what remains to be completed and add issues to `prd.json`.

Whenever doing front end changes use your front end skill to make sure the design and layout is good.

Whenever you are done, confirm that `npm run build` and `npm run test` complete successfully. Otherwise fix the errors.

Always commit changes before completing and returning.
